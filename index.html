By chance, a Catholic family saved her and raised her from age 3, until age 12, several years after the war had ended. The photo on the cover of her book is that of her grandmother who was gassed at Auschwitz September 30, 1942. Monique visited the camp September 30, 2015. The book also tells about 18 women she interviewed because they were Resistance fighters. The last one tells about her grandmother who remains the closest one to her heart .

She has spoken in schools and universities to students of all ages and in Jewish Community Centers, as well as other religious groups charitable organizations, libraries, book clubs, etc. She has had several book signings including several at the Holocaust Museum in Washington, DC in September 2014, July 2015 and October 2016.

											<h3>Mother and Father</h3>
											<p>My parents met at a dance in 1937. My father was born in Romania and was fluent in French because I discovered letters that he wrote to my mother during the war, in perfect French. My grandparents were born in Romania, but my mother was born in Marseilles, France.</p>

											<h3>Photo With Two Sisters, Monique and Jackie</h3>
											<p>I don’t exactly know when this picture was taken, but it was before August 26, 1942.  Later, when my grandmother was taken to Auschwitz, my 19 year old uncle took care of my sister. A few weeks later, the Baleste family found a widow in a different village who accepted to raise her.</p>
